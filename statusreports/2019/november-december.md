During November and December:
- Finished the circuit padding simulator with help from Mike Perry (Tor
  developer): [main repo](https://github.com/pylls/circpad-sim), [tor
  branch](https://github.com/mikeperry-tor/tor/tree/circpad-sim-v4), [context
  for
  use](https://github.com/torproject/tor/blob/master/doc/HACKING/CircuitPaddingDevelopment.md).
  The context for use is the official Tor Project documentation on the circuit
  padding framework. I now consider this work upstreamed to the Tor Project and
  shared with the wider community. Yay!
- Significant work on collecting a custom dataset for the circuit padding
  simulator (for later padding machine evaluation), associated evaluation tools,
  and some preliminary results. Unfortunately, this has all been in a private
  repository (sorry!). Current plan is to share all of this early next year as
  another useful result before we get to some actual padding machines.
- With the above results in mind, got a very good idea of how to move forward.
  Expecting to share some machines by the next status report. See you in 2020!
