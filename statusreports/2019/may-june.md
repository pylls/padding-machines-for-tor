The bad news is that it took me longer than expected to transition out of other
project work so I didn't get as much time as I wanted to in June. The good news
is that I've just finished "transitioning" out of one project and can start
working on this close to full-time for a couple of weeks before vacation. After
vacation I should have time to progress as planned.

In gist, during the first two project months I have:

- Setup this repository,
- explored a new way of collecting network traces based on --headless Firefox (Tor Browser),
- gotten access to more than adequate equipment at the department for future
  experiments, and
- slowly started wrapping my head around the circuitpadding framework in Tor.
