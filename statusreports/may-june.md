During May and June:
- More Covid-19 delay unfortunately but managed to wrap up phase 2 now, please
  see
  [here](https://github.com/pylls/padding-machines-for-tor/tree/master/machines/phase2/).
- Released three tools that are valuable for evaluating machines. One for
  computing [bandwidth
  overhead](https://github.com/pylls/padding-machines-for-tor/tree/master/machines/phase2/overhead.py),
  one for [visualizing
  traces](https://github.com/pylls/padding-machines-for-tor/tree/master/machines/phase2/visualize.py),
  and a third for
  [tweaking](https://github.com/pylls/padding-machines-for-tor/tree/master/machines/phase2/tweak.md)
  a pair of machines.

The plan is now to fine-tune the machines from phase 2, resulting in 1-2 final
machines, and then wrapping up the project in time for the next status report.
