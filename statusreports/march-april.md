During March and April:
- Covid-19 reached Sweden. Significant impact on my work and priorities,
  limiting time to work on this project. Still hoping to be able to finish
  before summer.
- Found a security bug in Tor by accident and responsibly disclosed it to the
  Tor Project. It got assigned
  [CVE-2020-10593](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10593),
  [TROVE-2020-004](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/33619) and was
  mentioned in a [Tor blog
  post](https://blog.torproject.org/new-releases-03510-0419-0427).
- Luckily, before Covid-19 hit, I finished tooling to evolve padding machines
  (not shared yet). While working on other things, my tooling has been running
  on evolving machines. So far it has run a bit over one month walltime,
  evaluating about 10^5 machines, performing in total about 4*10^18
  [circpad-sim](https://github.com/pylls/circpad-sim). Several viable machines
  have emerged with at least two distinct tactics for padding. Hoping that
  manual tuning in May will provide some improvement and that's it for phase 2.
