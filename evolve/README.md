# Evolving Machines

This is provided as-is for the sake of helping other researchers pondering
burning CPU and GPU for new machines. All code highly research grade, certified
mostly working by trial-and-error running on a single box. If you have any
questions, want to discuss approaches here, or just rant about how bad the code
is feel free to reach out for a chat.

The main file is `loop.py`. Happy digging!
